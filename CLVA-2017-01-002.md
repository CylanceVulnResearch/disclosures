# [CLVA-2017-01-002]: Gigabyte BRIX BIOS Write Protection is not enabled
# Summary
Cylance identified a vulnerability in the UEFI firmware for the Gigabyte GB-BSi7H-6500 and GB-BXi7-5775 platforms, which could allow attacker modify firmware from ring 0.## Product Description
The Gigabyte BRIX is a common Mini-PC Barebone platform (via [http://www.gigabyte.us/products/list.aspx?s=47&ck=104](http://www.gigabyte.us/products/list.aspx?s=47&ck=104)).
## Affected Products
* GB-BSi7H-6500 (UEFI firmware version: vF6 from 2016/05/18)* GB-BXi7-5775 (UEFI firmware version: vF2 from 2016/07/19)
## Impact
An attacker can modify the SPI flash image to install a persistent rootkit/bootkit or corrupt the firmware due to disabled-by-default flash write protection features.
# Vulnerability Information
* Cylance Identifier: CLVA-2017-01-002* CVE Identifier: CVE-2017-3198
## Description
A vulnerability has been identified in one of the UEFI firmwares from American Megatrends Inc. (AMI) used in Gigabyte's GB-BSi7H-6500 and GB-BXi7-5775 platforms. The security features (BIOSWE, BLE, SMM_BWP, PRx) for protecting the BIOS from arbitrary modifications are not enabled by default. The flash write protection mechanisms are not enabled by default and Intel BootGuard is not available for Gigabyte BRIX platforms. The firmware updates for Gigabyte BRIX platforms are not signed. During the firmware update process, an attacker may modify the platform firmware with persistent malicious code since no integrity check is performed.
## Impact
An attacker can use the AMI Firmware Update (AFU) to make arbitrary modifications of the SPI flash image from ring 0. As an example, this vulnerability may be used to write a rootkit/bootkit to the SPI flash image. The rootkit could persist across operating system re-installs and allow an attacker to bypass security features such as Secure Boot, Virtual Secure Mode, Device Guard.An attacker can also modify firmware policies using the AMI BIOS Configuration Program (AMIBCP) to unlock the Intel Direct Connect Interface (DCI) which may be used for platform debugging when running an Intel Skylake CPU over USB3 with the Intel SVT adapter.

## Attack Scenario

An attacker could use the AMI or Gigabyte firmware update tool to install a custom UEFI firmware or modify the SPI flash memory to install a persistent rootkit/bootkit.
## ResolutionGigabyte has released UEFI firmware version F7 to address this issue for the GB-BSi7H-6500 platform. However, the GB-BXi7-5775 is End Of Life (EOL), and therefore may not be receiving an update. Affected users should update the firmware as soon as possible. Firmware updates can be found at [Gigabyte's Support Page](http://www.gigabyte.com/Support).
