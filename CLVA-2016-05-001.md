# [CLVA-2016-05-001]: Crestron AM-100 Path Traversal Vulnerability

# Summary

Cylance identified a vulnerability in the Crestron AirMedia AM-100, which could allow an unauthenticated entity to read arbitrary files on affected devices. The unauthenticated user must be able to access the web server on the affected devices.

## Product Description

The Crestron AirMedia AM-100 allows users to "wirelessly present PowerPoint®, Excel®, Word, and PDF documents, as well as photos, on the room display from their personal iOS® or Android™ mobile device" or desktop/laptop. (via [http://www.crestron.com/microsites/airmedia-mobile-wireless-hd-presentations](http://www.crestron.com/microsites/airmedia-mobile-wireless-hd-presentations)).

## Affected Products

* Crestron AirMedia AM-100 (firmware v1.1.1.11 - v1.2.1)

## Impact

An unauthenticated entity may be able to read arbitrary files on the affected AM-100 as superuser ("root").

# Vulnerability Information

* Cylance Identifier: CLVA-2016-05-001
* CVE Identifier: CVE-2016-5639 

## Description

A path traversal vulnerability exists in `login.cgi` (and possibly other binaries in the `/home/boa/cgi-bin` directory) on the AM-100 embedded web server. The `src` GET parameter passed to `login.cgi` specifies the relative path to a file for rendering, such as `AwLoginDownload.html`. However, the value of this parameter can specify an arbitrary path on the AM-100 filesystem.

## Impact

The attacker may be able read the contents of unexpected files and expose sensitive data. Additionally, as the embedded web server runs as root, the attacker is unrestricted by filesystem permissions.

## Attack Scenario

An unauthenticated entity with access to the AM-100 embedded web server could, for example, read the system's password file, then conduct a brute force password guessing attack in order to break into an account on the system.

## Resolution

Crestron has released firmware version 1.4.0.13 to address this issue. Affected users should update the firmware of their AM-100 as soon as possible. Crestron partners can find the latest firmware at [http://www.crestron.com/products/model/AM-100](http://www.crestron.com/products/model/AM-100)

### Details for CLVA-2016-05-001

* Example of a benign/normal `GET` request for `login.cgi`:

...
```

* Example of expected response:
